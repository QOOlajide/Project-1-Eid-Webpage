    <p> Buraidah (radiyallāhu ‘anhu) said: “The Prophet (salallāhu ‘alaihi
        wasallam) would not leave home on the day of Fitr until he had eaten and he would not eat on the day of Adhā
        until he had prayed.” (Reported by Ahmad and others)
        Shaikh Taqiyyud-Deen Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullāh) said: Allah preceded the prayer before the sacrifice in His
        saying: (فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ) “So pray to your Lord and offer the sacrifice.” And He preceded the
        purification before the prayer in His saying: (قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَنْ تَزَكَّى وَذَكَرَ اسْمَ رَبِّهِ فَصَلَّى) “He
        has certainly succeeded who purifies himself. And mentions the name of his Lord and prays.” So the Sunnah is to
        give Sadaqah (Zakāt Al-Fitr as purification)
        before praying on the day of Fitr and to pray before sacrificing on ‘Eid Al-Adhā.
        It is the Sunnah to say the takbīrs aloud when leaving out for the ‘Eid Prayer. It is from the Sunnah to sit
        near the imām who leads the prayer and delivers the khutbah and there is a virtue in waiting for the prayer to
        begin. The method of takbīr of Ibn Mas’ūd (radiyallāhu ‘anhu) on the day of ‘Eid was:
        ‎اللّه أكبر • اللّه أكبر • اللّه أكبر • لا إله إلّا اللّه • اللّه أكبر • اللّه أكبر • وَللّهِ الحمد</p>
    <p>It is from the Sunnah to beautify oneself for the ‘Eid Prayer with the best garments one has due to the hadeeth
        of Jābir: “The Prophet (salallāhu ‘alaihi wasallam) would adorn himself with a garment that he would wear on the
        two ‘Eids and on the day of Jumu’ah.” (Reported by Ibn Khuzaymah in his Sahīh) It is reported from Ibn ‘Umar
        (radiyallāhu ‘anhumā) that “he would wear his best garments on the two ‘Eids.” (Reported by Al-Bayhaqi with a
        good isnād)
        Women must wear the correct hijāb over her house clothes according to the Sharī’ah―which is a khimār over which
        she wears a jilbāb. She does not apply make-up or wear perfume or high-heels in public. Please read:
        Understanding the Muslim Dress Code: Modesty for Men and the Hijāb for Women. The woman should fulfil the
        conditions of Jilbāb at all times.
        Women must attend the ‘Eid prayer too. Al-Bukhāri (no. 971) reported from Umm ‘Atiyyah (radiyallāhu anhā): “We
        were commanded to come out on the day of ‘Eid and to bring out the virgin girls from their houses and
        menstruating women so that they might stand behind the men and say takbīr along with them and supplicate to
        Allah along with them and hope for the blessings of that day and for purification from sins.”
        Menstruating women witness the prayer and enjoy the blessings of the occasion but do not pray. She (radiyallāhu
        ‘anhā) also said: “Allah’s Messenger would order the virgins, the mature women, the secluded and the
        menstruating women to go out for the two ‘Eids. As for the menstruating women, they were to stay away from the
        musallā (i.e. from the prayer) and participate in the Muslims supplications.” One of them said:
        “O Messenger of Allah! What if she does not have a jilbāb?” He said: “Then let her sister lend her a jilbāb.”

    <p>There comes in many hadith of Allah's Messenger (alayhi salam)...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A’ishah (radiyallāhu ‘anhā) said: “Abu Bakr entered our home (on the day of ‘Eid) and there were two girls
            from the Ansār with me, singing about the day of Bu’āth.” She said: “But they were not really singers.” Abu
            Bakr said: “The sounds of Shaytān in the house of the Prophet?” That was on the day of ‘Eid. However, the
            Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “O Abu Bakr, every people has its celebration and this is our
            celebration.” (Ibn Mājah, no. 1898) </li>
        <li>A’ishah (radiyallāhu ‘anhā) reported: “By Allah! I remember the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم)
            standing at the door of my apartment facing (the Mosque) screening me with his garment enabling me to see
            the sport of the Abyssinians as they played with their daggers in the Prophet’s Mosque. He kept standing for
            me till I was satisfied and then I went back ―and you can well imagine how long a woman of tender of age who
            is fond of sports could have watched it.” (Muslim, no. 892)</li>
        <li>‘A’ishah (radiyallāhu ‘anhā) reported: “Some Abyssinians came and gave a demonstration of an armed fight on
            the ‘Eid day in the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) invited me to watch. I placed my
            head on his shoulder and began to watch their sport until it was I who turned away.” (Muslim, no. 892) [All
