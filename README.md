# Project-1-Eid-Webpage
# 2025 Eid-Al-Fitr Festivity Webpage 🎉🕌

## 🌙 About the Project
This is a personal web development journey where I’m building a dynamic, user-friendly webpage dedicated to the 2025 Eid al-Adha celebration. Over ten weeks, I’ll be adding new features while learning and applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The site aims to:
- Support attendees of the Eid prayer with timely, helpful information
- Provide an engaging and educational space for both Muslims and non-Muslims
- Offer interactive features like event schedules, Zakat payment, and kids' activities
- Deliver real-time updates and spiritual guidance in a simple, accessible format

---

## 🧭 Project Goals
- Reinforce my front-end development skills through real-world application
- Build incrementally, one week at a time
- Avoid full plug-and-play solutions — I’m designing and coding each element as I grow
- Create a welcoming digital space for Eid attendees

## 🙌 Contributions & Feedback
This is a solo learning project, but I welcome constructive feedback! Feel free to explore, clone, or fork the project as it evolves.

## 📌 Note
I’m intentionally avoiding frameworks and templates to challenge myself and better understand the building blocks of the web. Each feature is added thoughtfully, week by week, as part of a deeper learning process.
